# Predicting-herd-immunity-in-India
In this project I have performed analysis of covid-19 cases across different states in India using various functions like scatter plots, bar plots, heatmaps. Then on the basis of the vaccination data of India, I have performed further analysis on state-wise covid-19 vaccinations, and on the basis of the data, I predicted when India would be able to achieve herd immunity(percentage for herd immunity = 60%) using the "Prophet" and "Neural Prophet" model by Meta and compared their results.
Kindly checkout the pdf version of the project too, as it has additional graphs which were not visible in the main file when it was uploaded on github
